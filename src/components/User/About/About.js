              I am an engineering student in the second year of Software
              Engineering and Distributed Computer Systems (GLSID) at the Ecole
              Normale Sup√©rieure d'Education Technique - Mohammedia (ENSET-M).
              Through my university studies, I acquired strong skills in the
              field of software engineering. The various projects that I have
              carried out as well as the internships I have completed have
              enabled me to develop not only my know-how but also my
              interpersonal skills. Motivated, I know how to adapt, I have a
              sense of responsibility and organization.
